How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	- Using diff two files were displayed side by side, so easier to view
	- Differences were highlighted, so easy to pinpoint 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?	
	- Changes made to a file can help you understand the process of development
	- History can help troubleshoot a scenario when an existing working feature is broken by some change
	- Help to switch back to old version easily if new version is not really useful

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	- Pros
		- User can choose a logical point which will make sense when looked at to diff or in history
		- Manageble history
	- Cons
		- Compared to auto-save feature, manual save require more attention other wise user might loose work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	- Becuase Git is mainly developed for code and it makes sense to keep history of multiple files together in each commit
	- GDocs are mainly for documents 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	- git log : can be used to view history of logs for each commit and changes. It will show the latest change at top with commit id,autohor,date and message.
	- git diff : can be used to compare two commits via copying the commit ids from the logs and running git diff commitID1 commitID2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	- git checkout commitID can be used to resotre the whole repo to a specific version of the repo
	- Even if a bug is introduced by mistake, user can revert to a known working state and then progressively move to latest builds to fiugre out where the bug was
	introduced
	- Before reverting back to a previous commit, do git log and note the commit ID of latest version
